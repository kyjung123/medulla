/**
 * @file test.h
 * @brief Header file for the framework test library.
 * @details This file contains the declarations of functions and types used for
 * testing the framework functionality, including interaction- and particle-
 * level variables, matching between truth and reconstructed objects, and all
 * manner of cases surrounding these functionalities. This is, essentially,
 * intended to be a "brute force" test of the framework, ensuring that all
 * functionality works as expected. The alternative is a full "logic" test
 * of the framework, which does tend to be more error-prone due to the 
 * variety of possible cases and the complexity of the logic involved.
